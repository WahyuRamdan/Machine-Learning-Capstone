Collecting a dataset from Kaggle then adding it with some data that we got from AI or adding it manually, the modeling has been split into training and validation. Our model selector has carried out several trials, then selected a model that has high or sufficient accuracy. Model selection is already at the evaluation stage, the evaluation has been carried out such as changes to hyperparameters.
